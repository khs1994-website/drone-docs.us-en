This guide covers configuring continuous integration pipelines for projects that have a MariaDB dependency. If you're new to Drone please read our Tutorial and build configuration guides first.

# Basic Example

In the below example we demonstrate a pipeline that launches a MariaDB service container. The database server will be available at `database:3306`, where the hostname matches the service container name.


```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=["11-16"]}
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: test
  image: mariadb
  commands:
  - sleep 15
  - mysql -u root -h database --execute="SELECT VERSION();"

services:
- name: database
  image: mariadb
  environment:
    MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: 'yes'
    MYSQL_DATABASE: test
```

# Database Settings

The official MariaDB image provides environment variables used at startup
to create the default username, password, database and more. Please see the
official image [documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) for more details.


```yaml {linenos=table,linenostart=11,hl_lines=["4-6"]}
services:
- name: database
  image: mariadb
  environment:
    MYSQL_DATABASE: test
    MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD: 'yes'
```

# Common Problems

## Initialization

If you are unable to connect to the MariaDB container please make sure you
are giving MariaDB adequate time to initialize and begin accepting
connections.

```yaml {linenos=table,hl_lines=["8"]}
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: test
  image: mariadb
  commands:
  - sleep 15
  - mysql -u root -h database
```

## Incorrect Hostname

You cannot use `127.0.0.1` or `localhost` to connect with the MariaDB container. If you are unable to connect to MariaDB please verify you are using the correct hostname, corresponding with the name of the container. 

Bad:

```
steps:
- name: test
  image: mariadb
  commands:
  - sleep 15
  - mysql -u root -h localhost
```

Good:

```
steps:
- name: test
  image: mariadb
  commands:
  - sleep 15
  - mysql -u root -h database

services:
- name: database
  image: mariadb
```
