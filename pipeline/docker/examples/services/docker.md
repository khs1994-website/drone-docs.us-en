This guide covers configuring continuous integration pipelines for projects that have a Docker dependency. If you're new to Drone please read our Tutorial and build configuration guides first.

# Basic Example

In the below example we demonstrate a pipeline that connects to the host machine Docker daemon by mounting a volume. For security reasons, only trusted repositories can mount volumes. Furthermore, mounting the host machine Docker socket is highly insecure, and should only be used in trusted environments.

```

kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: test
  image: docker:dind
  volumes:
  - name: dockersock
    path: /var/run/docker.sock
  commands:
  - docker ps -a

volumes:
- name: dockersock
  host:
    path: /var/run/docker.sock
