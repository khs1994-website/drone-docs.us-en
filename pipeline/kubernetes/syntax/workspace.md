  Describes the pipeline workspace and directory structure.

Drone automatically creates a temporary volume, known as your workspace, where it clones your repository. The workspace is the current working directory for each step in your pipeline.

Because the workspace is a volume, filesystem changes are persisted between pipeline steps. In other words, individual steps can communicate and share state using the workspace filesystem.

Workspace path inside your pipeline containers:

```
/drone/src
```

<div class="alert alert-warn">
Note the workspace volume is ephemeral. It is created when the pipeline starts and destroyed after the pipeline completes.
</div>
