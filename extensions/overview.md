You can use extensions to override and customize Drone's default behavior. If Drone does _almost_ everything you want, you can use extensions to enhance Drone to accommodate _all_ of your team's unique requirements.

Extensions are simple HTTP services that receive and respond to requests using a REST protocol. You can write extensions in any language, although we do provide starter projects for the Go programming language.

Here is a list of extension types:
