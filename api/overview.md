  Overview of the remote API.
---

Drone provides a comprehensive remote API for interacting with the Drone server. This section of the documents provides instructions for authenticating and using the remote API.

# Authorization

The remote API uses access tokens to authorize requests. You can retrieve an access token in the Drone user interface by navigating to your user profile.

Authorization to the API is performed using the HTTP Authorization header. Provide your token as the bearer token value.

* Example Header.

  ```
  Authorization: Bearer AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
  ```

* Example Request.

  ```
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/user" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
  ```
