  Install the runner.
---

<div class="alert">
The AWS runner is in the Release Candidate phase.
</div>

This article explains how to install the AWS runner on Linux. The AWS runner is packaged as a minimal Docker image distributed on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/drone/drone-runner-aws).

# Download

Install Docker and pull the public image:

``` bash
docker pull drone/drone-runner-aws
```

# Configuration

The AWS runner is configured using environment variables. This article references the below configuration options. See [Configuration]({{< relref "configuration/reference" >}}) for a complete list of configuration options.

- __DRONE_RPC_HOST__
  : provides the hostname (and optional port) of your Drone server. The runner connects to the server at the host address to receive pipelines for execution.
- __DRONE_RPC_PROTO__
  : provides the protocol used to connect to your Drone server. The value must be either http or https.
- __DRONE_RPC_SECRET__
  : provides the shared secret used to authenticate with your Drone server. This must match the secret defined in your Drone server configuration.

# AWS specific Configuration

## AWS EC2 prerequisites

There are some pieces of setup that need to be performed on the AWS side first.

- Set up an access key and access secret, more info here [aws secret](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html#Using_CreateAccessKey) which is needed for configuration of the pools.

  __Alternatively__ use an IAM role to manage pool instances on aws drone runner. To use the IAM role, aws runner needs to run on EC2 instance with IAM role having CRUD permissions on EC2. This will allow the runner to use the instanceâ€™s IAM role to get temporary security credentials to make calls to AWS for managing pool & removes requirement of specifying `access_key_id` and `access_key_secret`.
- Setup up vpc firewall rules for the build instances [ec2 authorizing-access-to-an-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html) We need allow ingress and egress access to port 9079. Once complete you will have a security group id, which is needed for configuration of the runner.
- (optional) For debugging purposes, you can amend the security group with the following rules:

  - `SSH TCP 22   0.0.0.0/0` for linux.
  - `RDP TCP 3389 0.0.0.0/0` for windows.

  This will allow you to remotely connect to the build instances. Once you set `key_pair_name`.

## Pool specific environment variables

Set up the runner by using either an environment variables or a `.env` file similar to other Drone runners. Below is a list of the specific environment variables that you can override.

- __DRONE_REUSE_POOL__
  : Reuse existing instances on restart of the runner. This is set to `true` by default.
- __DRONE_LITE_ENGINE_PATH__
  : The web URL for the path containing lite-engine binaries. This can be hosted internally or you can get the binaries from github. This defaults to a tested version of lite-engine.

  If you are moving from an older version, some change to setup may be required, they are outlined [here]({< relref "version migration" >}}).

## Example AWS Runner configuration `.env` file

{{< highlight bash "linenos=table" >}}
DRONE_RPC_HOST=localhost:8080
DRONE_RPC_PROTO=http
DRONE_RPC_SECRET=bea26a2221fd8090ea38720fc445eca6
DRONE_REUSE_POOL=false
{{< / highlight >}}

# Pool File

The AWS runner requires a pool file `pool.yml`, this describes the number and type of instances to create in a hot swappable pool. For example:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table" >}}
version: "1"
instances:
  - name: ubuntu-aws
    default: true
    type: amazon
    pool: 1    # total number of warm instances in the pool at all times
    limit: 100  # limit the total number of running servers. If exceeded block or error.
    platform:
      os: linux
      arch: amd64
    spec:
      account:
        region: us-east-2
        availability_zone: us-east-2c
        access_key_id: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
        access_key_secret: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      ami: ami-051197ce9cbb023ea
      size: t2.nano
      network:
        security_groups:
          - XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
{{< / highlight >}}

See [Pool file]({{< relref "configuration/pool.md" >}}) for more detailed information.

# Installation

We can use a config folder that contains the necessary configuration files.

```
ls  /path/on/host/config/
.drone_pool.yml
.env
```

The below command creates a container and starts the runner.

```
docker run -d \
  --volume=/path/on/host/config:/config/ \
  --publish=3000:3000 \
  --restart always \
  --name runner \
  drone/drone-runner-aws /config/.env /config/pool.yml
```

# Verification

Use the docker logs command to view the logs and verify the runner successfully established a connection with the Drone server.

```
$ docker logs runner
