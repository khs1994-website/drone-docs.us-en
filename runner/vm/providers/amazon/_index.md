# Overview

**By default it will create a pool with a max size of 2 running Ubuntu 18.04. The pools is called `test_pool`.**
Currently the runner is only supports amazon, but in the future it will support other cloud providers and virtual machines.

Amazon specific configuration in a pool file.

## Authentication

By default we require access_key_id and access_key_secret which is needed for create an the instance.

__Alternatively__ use an IAM role to manage pool instances on aws drone runner. To use the IAM role, aws runner needs to run on EC2 instance with IAM role having CRUD permissions on EC2. This will allow the runner to use the instanceâ€™s IAM role to get temporary security credentials to make calls to AWS for managing pool & removes requirement of specifying `access_key_id` and `access_key_secret`.

## VPC

By default it will use the default VPC for that user or you can specify the VPC id.

## Security groups

By default it will create the necessary security group. It is named "harness runner".

__Alternatively__ you can specify your own security group and passing its ID to the pool file. Firewall rules for the build instances [ec2 authorizing-access-to-an-instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/authorizing-access-to-an-instance.html) We need allow ingress and egress access to port 9079. Once complete you will have a security group id, which is needed for configuration of the runner.

- (optional) For debugging purposes, you can amend the security group with the following rules:

  - `SSH TCP 22   0.0.0.0/0` for linux.
  - `RDP TCP 3389 0.0.0.0/0` for windows.

  This will allow you to remotely connect to the build instances. Once you set `key_pair_name`.

# Recommended AMIs

+ [Windows Server 2019 with containers](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iehgssex6veoi)
+ [Ubuntu 20.04](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iftkyuwv2sjxi?sr=0-2&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa)

Depending on the AMI's you are using, you may need to subscribe to it. We have tested against [Ubuntu 20.04](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iftkyuwv2sjxi?sr=0-2&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) or [Windows 2019 with containers](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-iehgssex6veoi?sr=0-6&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa).

instances:
  - name: ubuntu-aws
    default: true
