The goal of this document is to give you enough technical specifics to configure and run google instances. When properly configured, it will automatically provision and terminate Google Compute Engine instances based on your Drone serverâ€™s build volume.

# Prerequisites

## Create Google Credentials file

If your vm runner is running in a GCP instance then create `application_default_credentials.json` by executing next command in the GCP instance:
```
gcloud auth application-default login
```

And credentials will be saved in `/home/$(whoami)/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json`.

Otherwise, [create service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts), [generate credentials file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) and save it somewhere in the machine where plan to run the vm runner.
