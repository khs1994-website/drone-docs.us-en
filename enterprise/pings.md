Drone periodically sends a ping to drone.io to help our product and customer teams. It sends only the high-level data below. It never sends code, repository names, or any other proprietary data.

Example payload:

```json {linenos=table}
{
    "installed_by": "jane@acme.com",
    "installed_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
    "ip": "1.2.3.4",
    "hostname": "drone.acme.com",
    "provider": "github",
    "license": "trial",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "user_count": 25,
    "repo_count": 50,
    "build_count": 2500,
}
```

* `installed_by`
  : email address of the initial site installer (or if deleted, the first active site admin) collected from the user registration screen
* `installed_at`
  : installation date
