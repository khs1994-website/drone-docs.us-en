String value configures the file extension that should be used with the conversion plugin. This configuration parameter is used to reduce un-necessary traffic to the conversion plugin for file types that will not otherwise be converted. It is completely optional.

```
DRONE_CONVERT_PLUGIN_EXTENSION=.star
