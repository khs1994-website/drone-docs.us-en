# Creating Secrets

Create a secret from the AWS console. In the below example we store the Docker username and password.

# Accessing Secrets

Once our secrets are stored in AWS, we can update our yaml configuration file to request access to our secrets. First we define a secret resource in our yaml for each external secret. We include the path to the secret, and the name or key of value we want to retrieve:

{{< highlight text "linenos=table,hl_lines=10-21" >}}
---
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: alpine

---
kind: secret
name: username
get:
  path: prod/docker
  name: username

---
kind: secret
name: password
get:
  path: prod/docker
  name: password
...
{{< / highlight >}}

We can then reference the named secrets in our pipeline:

{{< highlight text "linenos=table,hl_lines=8-11" >}}
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: alpine
  environment:
    USERNAME:
      from_secret: username
    PASSWORD:
      from_secret: password

---
kind: secret
name: username
get:
  path: prod/docker
  name: username

---
kind: secret
name: password
get:
  path: prod/docker
  name: password

...
{{< / highlight >}}
