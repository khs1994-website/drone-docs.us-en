  Store sensitive information as encrypted strings in your configuration file.

Encrypted secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as passwords, tokens, and ssh keys directly in your configuration file as an encrypted string. Each secret is represented as a yaml document in your configuration file.

You can use the command line tools to encrypt secrets. Each secret is encrypted with a per-repository encryption key using aesgcm. This key never leaves the server environment.

Example command to encrypt the secret:

```
$ drone encrypt <repository> <secret>
```

```
$ drone encrypt octocat/hello-world top-secret-password
hl3v+FODjduX0UpXBHgYzPzVTppQblg51CVgCbgDk4U=
```

Example configuration with encrypted secrets:

{{< highlight yaml "linenos=table,hl_lines=8-9 12-14" >}}
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: alpine
  environment:
    USERNAME:
      from_secret: username

kind: secret

Secrets are not exposed to pull requests that originate from forks. This prevents a bad actor from sending a pull request and attempting to expose your secrets.
